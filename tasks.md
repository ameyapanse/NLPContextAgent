## Steps:
- Read up langchain, chroma documentation
- Install the required packages
- Get .md files from git for data
- Import data into chroma
- Play around
- Test out openapi key
- Get query embedding
- Get topk similarity scores with data
- Generate final query
- Citations ? Add meta data to md files, see if chroma does it automatically
  - Again similarity?
  - Check api response, maybe helpful
- Conversational ? Seems like langchain openai has an api. 
- Create cli/python wrapper
- Summary ? Keep the conversation handy. Then generate summary
- Scaling plan. Think about this
- Clean README, pipreq
