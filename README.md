# Multi-Layer Cross Loss Model for Zero-Shot Human Activity Recognition

Utilizes LLMs and open-source vector indexing and storage frameworks to answer simple questions over a small set of lecture notes and a table of LLM architectures.

## Data :
- Stanford LLMs Lecture Notes: https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2022/lectures/ (create conversational intelligence over 3-4 lectures of your choosing, but be sure to include the introduction lecture)
- https://github.com/Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM#milestone-papers (only the table of model architectures)
